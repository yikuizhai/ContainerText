![](/figure1.jpeg)

To obtain the ContainerText dataset:
    1. Use the school's email address (edu, stu, etc.) and send an email to: yikuizhai@126.com
    2. Sign the relevant agreement to ensure that it will only be used for scientific research and not for commercial purposes.A scanned version of the agreement that requires a handwritten signature. Both Chinese and English signatures are acceptable.
    3. Authorization will be obtained in 1-3 days. (Notice: If you use this dataset as the benchmark dataset for your paper, please cite the paper in eula.pdf)
